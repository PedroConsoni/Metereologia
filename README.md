# Meteorologia

I am pleased to present "Meteorologia", a weather forecast website I developed to consolidate and expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The project allowed me to explore integration with external APIs, using OpenWeatherMap.org to fetch and display real-time weather data in a practical and efficient way.

## Project Highlights

- Development of a friendly and responsive interface;  
- **API consumption** to display accurate and up-to-date information;  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Web page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – Project logic and API integration  

## How to Use

You can access the project in two ways:

### 1. Online
