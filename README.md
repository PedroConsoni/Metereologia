# Meteorologia

I am pleased to present "Meteorologia", a weather forecast website I developed to consolidate and expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The project allowed me to explore integration with external APIs, using OpenWeatherMap.org to fetch and display real-time weather data in a practical and efficient way.

## Project Highlights

- Development of a friendly and responsive interface;  
- **API consumption** to display accurate and up-to-date information;  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Web page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – Project logic and API integration  

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
2. Enter the name of the desired city to see the weather forecast.  
3. Check information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind in real time.
